# Applications of Data Mining methods on Breast Cancer Dataset
Breast cancer is considered one of the deadliest diseases.
Only in the USA,1 out of 8 women develops breast cancer over the course
of their lifetime. And for women in the US, its death rate is second only
to lung cancer.

In this report, I will illustrate the results of classification, clustering, and
frequent pattern mining techniques on the breast cancer data set. The
breast cancer domain that was used for this report was obtained from the
University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.
Thanks go to M. Zwitter and M. Soklic for providing the data.
